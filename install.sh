# Lowercase the SDK headers and libraries. As long as cl.exe is executed
# within wine, this is mostly not necessary.
#
# (Older versions of cl.exe needed it, because those versions would produce
# dependency paths with incorrect casing for some headers, breaking rebuilds
# with tools that check dependencies.)
#
# But lowercasing the headers allows using them with case sensitive native
# tools (such as clang-cl and lld-link). Leaving their original casing isn't
# an option, because the headers aren't self consistent (headers are
# included with a different mix of upper/lower case than what they have
# on disk).
