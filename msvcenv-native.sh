# This is a script for setting up env variables for letting native tools
# find headers and libraries installed by the other msvc-wine scripts.
#
# To use this script, execute it like this:
#     BIN=<path-to-msvc-wine-install>/bin/x64 . ./msvcenv-native.sh
# (Note the "." between the BIN variable and the msvcenv-native.sh script.)
# After executing this, you should be able to run clang-cl and lld-link
# without needing to configure paths manually anywhere.
# (If linking by invoking clang or clang-cl, instead of directly calling
# lld-link, it's recommended to use -fuse-ld=lld.)

    echo Set BIN to point to the directory before launching
